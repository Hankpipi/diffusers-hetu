## Benchmarks

### Run Different Baselines

In this part, you need to use the virtual environment of the original diffusers.

```shell
conda activate diffusers
```

Note that to run scripts of different image-edit pipelines, you should first generate the dataset (at least `dataset/hetu_origin`). And you should move the scripts to your **workspace**, so that it could read the dataset directly. 

For instance, you could run the following commands to run an SDEdit pipeline.

```shell
cd dataset && mkdir SDEdit && cd ..
python SDEdit.py
```

### Evaluate 

You should first move the scripts from `eval` directory to your **workspace**. Then, to obtain the image CLIP embeddings, you should change the root in `image_clip.py` to evaluate on the images you have just generated (`dataset/hetu_edit` by default). Note that it's also necessary to obtain the text CLIP embeddings (only need once) before measuring the metrics.

```shell
python image_clip.py
python text_clip.py
```

Then, you could simply run the scripts after adjusting the root to your `.pth` files generated by `image_clip.py` and `text_clip.py`.

```shell
python image_image_similarity.py
python direction_similarity.py
python clip_accuracy.py
```
